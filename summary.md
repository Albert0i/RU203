2. Field-Specific Searches

Let's review how to query a `TAG` field in RediSearch. There are two key points:

- Use the @ symbol before the field name
- Surround the search term with curly braces

For example, here's how we query the books index (called books-idx) for a specific ISBN value:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@isbn:{9780393059168}"
```

This is an example of searching one field. When we talk about boolean logic and later about full-text search, you'll see examples of searching across multiple fields.

3. Escaping Punctuation

**A note on querying with punctuation:** To query for a tag that includes punctuation, like an email address, you need to escape the punctuation (the data in the underlying Hash does not need to be escaped). For example, if we had a tag for "j. r. r. tolkien" instead of author ID, to query it you would need to write **@authors:{j\\. r\\. r\\. tolkien}**.

As you can see, you escape punctuation by preceding it with two backslashes (\\).

So, as a general rule you, should always escape the following punctuation in TAG field queries:

,.<>{}[]"':;!@#$%^&*()-+=~

4. [Working with Numbers](https://youtu.be/grBk0_iz-BM)

Try finding the titles of books with an average rating from 4.5 through 5:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@average_rating:[4.5 5]" RETURN 1 title
```

Now find the titles of books with an average rating from 0 through 1:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@average_rating:[0 1]" RETURN 1 title
```

Next, find the titles of books having an average rating of at least 4 and being published on or after 2015:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@average_rating:[4 +inf] @published_year:[2015 +inf]" RETURN 1 title
```

Finally, find the titles of books with an average rating of at most 3 published before 2000:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@average_rating:[-inf 3] @published_year:[-inf (2000]" RETURN 1 title
```

5. [Working with Dates and Times](https://youtu.be/TuWdvZNEsmI)

Try finding users who have logged in on or after 1:25pm UTC on December 11, 2020:
```
FT.SEARCH users-idx "@last_login:[1607693100 +inf]"
```

Now try to find users whose last login was prior to 1:25pm UTC on December 11, 2020:
```
FT.SEARCH users-idx "@last_login:[-inf (1607693100]"
```

You'll have to use a tool like the [UnixTimestampConverter](http://www.unixtimestampconverter.com/) to get the correct timestamp.

6. [Boolean Logic](https://youtu.be/lH8m4bBVg-k)

7. Full-Text Search

Many of the queries in this section use full-text search because this type of query makes boolean logic simple to illustrate.

Queries that don’t use a specific field default to full-text search using all TEXT fields. So, consider again the following query, taken from the last video:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "dogs|cats"
```

This query searches for dogs OR cats in all TEXT fields in the index.

For now, don’t worry about exactly how full-text search works. Focus on the boolean logic, and we’ll tell you all about full-text search in the next section.

8. Combining Multiple Fields

You can also use boolean logic to combine terms from multiple fields.

Here, we use a boolean AND to find books with the author “rowling” that have “goblet” in the title.
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@authors:rowling @title:goblet"
```

Just like when you use a boolean OR for terms in a single field, you connect two fields with a boolean OR by joining them with a pipe. In this query, we find books by the author “rowling” or that have “potter” in the title.
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@authors:rowling | @title:potter"
```

And same as with searching for terms in a field, use the dash symbol for a NOT query between fields. In this query, I'm looking for books by Tolkien whose titles do not include the word "ring".
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@authors:tolkien -@title:ring"
```

Try getting Stephen King books published between 1980 and 1990, inclusive.
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@authors:'Stephen King' @published_year:[1980 1990]"
```

Now try finding books with the Philosophy category, published on or before 1975, written by anyone other than Arthur Koestler.
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@categories:{Philosophy} @published_year:[-inf 1975] -@authors:'Arthur Koestler'"
```

Note: We use curly braces around “Philosophy” in this query because “categories” is a TAG field. As you may recall from our section on exact-string matches, querying TAG fields requires curly braces.

Finally, try finding books written by Aruthur Koestler OR Michel Foucault:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@authors:'Arthur Koestler' | @authors:'Michel Foucault'"
```

9. [Sorting Results](https://youtu.be/UpCUKPbCn3U)

10. Descending Sort

Here's the same query from the video you just watched, but this time with results sorted in descending order:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@published_year:[2018 +inf]" SORTBY published_year DESC
```

11. Sorting by Multiple Fields

The SORTBY option to FT.SEARCH allows you to sort by only one field per query. However, as you’ll see when we talk about aggregations, you can sort an aggregation query by more than one field.

Try finding Juvenile Fiction books sorted by the year they were published:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@categories:{Juvenile Fiction}" SORTBY published_year
```

Now try finding books with an average rating between 4.9 and 5 inclusive, sorted by average rating in descending order:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@average_rating:[4.9 5]" SORTBY average_rating DESC
```

12. [Limiting Results](https://youtu.be/pK5uWyqgcAo)

13. Pagination

You can use LIMIT for pagination. To get the first five Agatha Christie books ordered by publication date, you might write this:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@authors:Agatha Christie" SORTBY published_year LIMIT 0 5
```

And to get the next five Agatha Christie books, you could write this:
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@authors:Agatha Christie" SORTBY published_year LIMIT 5 5
```

Try searching for books written by Ursula K. Le Guin, ordered by publication year, and limiting the query to the first 3 books published.
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@authors:Ursula K. Le Guin" SORTBY "published_year" LIMIT 0 3
```

Next, try some offset and limit pagination. Starting at offset 100, get the next 100 books from the Fiction category published on or after the year 2000.
```
FT.SEARCH books-idx "@published_year:[2000 +inf]" LIMIT 100 100
```
